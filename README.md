A simple portfolio site to showcase my web development work. Redesigned and refactored to include a blog section, one of two front-ends for a full-stack application including a separate CMS front-end and an API only back-end.

Penultimate project in the NodeJS course of the Full Stack JavaScript curriculum @ [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-blog-api).

## Reflection

Although it wasn't a requirement in the curriculum I decided to go ahead and build the front-ends for this project in React making this a full-stack MERN app. After some short deliberation I settled on a simple redesign of my portfolio in vanilla CSS and to focus on making the blog section fetch and load data in a performant manner, at least compared with my past projects. With this in mind I decided to use Context API to try and avoid request waterfalls. I also tried wrangling with the component structure to limit re-renders but more can definitely be done to improve this. I learned a lot in this project and I'm excited to try out some different solutions for the next one.
