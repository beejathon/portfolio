# Portfolio

View portfolio @ [https://paiz.dev](https://paiz.dev)

A simple portfolio site to showcase my web development work. Redesigned and refactored to include a blog section, one of two front-ends for a full-stack application including a separate CMS front-end and an API only back-end.

Penultimate project in the NodeJS course of the Full Stack JavaScript curriculum @ [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-blog-api).

## Reflection

The first refactor of my portfolio in 2023 added a blog section as part of a full stack app and was focused primarily on practicing the Context API and fetching and loading data performantly. One year later I've refactored with Vite + React + React Router Data API + Tailwind CSS + ShadCN. As I continue to progress and learn more I plan to refactor this portfolio to showcase my projects as well as my adoption of new tech.
